//! Cache purge planning + driver (skeleton).
//!
//! Goal: free at least `target_chunks` chunks across the cache by evicting
//! the oldest chunks, where "oldest" is defined by the access-epoch column
//! in the sidecar (see `epoch.rs`).
//!
//! Two-pass design — chosen so we don't have to maintain per-purge
//! histograms separately from the global `epoch_chunks` snapshot:
//!
//! 1. **Plan.** Walk the global `EpochState::epoch_chunks()` histogram in
//!    modular age order (oldest first, starting at `(current + 1) % 256`).
//!    Accumulate until we cross the target; the threshold age T is the
//!    cutoff.
//! 2. **Sweep.** Walk every per-volume Sidecar; for each chunk with
//!    `access_epoch` in the "older than T" set, transition the state
//!    bitmap to Missing (Release) and punch a hole in the matching shard.
//!
//! The state-bitmap transition happens BEFORE the hole punch on purpose —
//! a reader that already passed the Resident check before the bitmap was
//! updated may read zeros, which our consumers tolerate as a transient
//! glitch (re-validates on the next frame). The reverse order would let a
//! reader return Resident bytes that have already been deallocated, which
//! is a permanent corruption window. Always: bitmap-first, then punch.
//!
//! This module currently provides only the planner and an evict-victim
//! API stub. Wiring to actual purge triggers (write-bytes counter, statvfs
//! poll) is intentionally deferred.
